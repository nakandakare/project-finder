Bugs:

cant upload projects after user registration

Cannot read property 'map' of null on CHAT TAB -> PROJECT USER.
Use Loading and Make initial state of project user to Empty Array []

Chat page not loading when changed account.

Tasks:

loading(placeholder) on project at chat
loading(placeholder) on last messages
move Project-Create to better place to avoid using showHandler in saga

dont show project MEMBERS when '/chat/

Memo: 

projectId ownerId requestUserId note        active (middleware auth)
44          41         45         "hola"     true

if accept request : 
change to inactive
projectId requestUserId in user_project_table
and notificate

if reject :
change to inactive
nothing
and notificate
